# Dependency graph

    `<report the here the dependency graph of EzWallet>`

# Integration approach

    <Write here the integration sequence you adopted, in general terms (top down, bottom up, mixed) and as sequence
    (ex: step1: unit A, step 2: unit A+B, step 3: unit A+B+C, etc)>
    <Some steps may  correspond to unit testing (ex step1 in ex above)>
    <One step will  correspond to API testing, or testing unit route.js>

# Tests

   <in the table below list the test cases defined For each test report the object tested, the test level (API, integration, unit) and the technique used to define the test case  (BB/ eq partitioning, BB/ boundary, WB/ statement coverage, etc)>   `<split the table if needed>`
